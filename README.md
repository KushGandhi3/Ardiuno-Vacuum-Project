# Ardiuno-Vacuum-Project
The purpose of this project is to clean a room floor from small debris and dust/dirt autonomously. A pair of hobby gear motors and a swivel wheel at the front will allow the robot vacuum to move about, and an ultrasonic sensor will detect any objects in front of it. A DC motor with a fan blade will act as a suction system to clean. When the user chooses, the vacuum may also switch to remote control mode, allowing the vacuum to be operated using an IR remote. Two LEDs will show the robot's statuses, one showing whether it is on or off and the other indicating the mode (autonomous or remote-controlled). Finally, a potentiometer will allow the user to control the speed of the 2 gear motors, faster speeds will allow for a quicker clean while slower clean will allow for a more thorough clean.
